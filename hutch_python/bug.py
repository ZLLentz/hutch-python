    Get the current CONDA environment

    The environment name is gathered by first checking environment variable
    ``$CONDA_ENVNAME`` that is set by the hutch-python startup scripts. If for
    whatever reason that is not available we check ``$CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV`` which
    is set by Conda itself. The reason this is not relied on primarily is it
    has a strange name and is entirely undocumented but seems to work
    effectively.

    In addition the hutch-python startup script sets the ``PYTHONPATH`` to pick
    up packages in "development" mode. The list of package names installed this
    way is found to help inform how the current Python environment differs from
    the enforced CONDA environment
